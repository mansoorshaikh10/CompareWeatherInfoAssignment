# CompareWeatherInfoAssignment

Ths project compares weather reporting done by 2 sources.

### Introduction:

This project compare temperature readings from two different sources listed below. We can extend this to add the comparision for different parameters as well with a similar variance logic.
Source 1 : The website https://www.ndtv.com/ .
Source 2 : The public weather API by https://openweathermap.org/


### Technology:
Amazon Corretto JDK 11.0.9_12 
Selenium 3.141.59
TestNG 6.14.3
Rest Assured 4.3.0
Extent Reports 5.0.8


### Usage:
Using the code we can get temperature information from a UI source (NDTV) and from an open API for any particular city. Additionaly we can also compare the readings from both the sources to check the difference using a defined variance logic.

### Contributing:
